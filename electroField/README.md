## Description
This program visualize vectors of the electrical field for point-like objects with an electrostatic charge.

Input:
N - number of points
N strings of type 'x y q'
x, y - coordinates of points in meters (-5 <= x, y <= 5 to be visible)
q - charge in coulombs

Then it will show matplotlib window with specified points and vectors of the electrical field.

## Dependencies
- matplotlib 3.3.4
- numpy 1.20.1
