## Description
By providing one of the graphs of specified thermodynamic process calculates two other with 3D visualization.

Input:
1. Choose one of the type of the graph to be provided:
	- pV
	- pT
	- VT
2. N - number of points in the graph (points of process' switch)
3. Choose if the graph is cyclic or not
4. For N points choose specified values (p in pascals, V in m^3, T in kelvins) 
5. For all shown processes choose type of the line:
	- l - straight line
	- c - hyperbola

Then the program will show all calculated graphs in matplotlib windows.

## Dependencies
- matplotlib 3.3.4
- numpy 1.20.1
